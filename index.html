          <h2>Overview</h2>
          <p>
            Generative AI (GenAI) systems such as ChatGPT, Gemini, Character AI, and LLaMA are rapidly changing how youth
            interact with technology. Youth are beginning to view GenAI as creative partners, conversational companions,
            and sources of emotional connection, introducing new opportunities and challenges for well-being and
            development.
          </p>
          <p>
            This workshop brings together researchers, designers, educators, policymakers, and youth-focused
            practitioners to critically examine how GenAI shapes youths' social, cognitive, emotional, moral, and
            identity development, and to co-create developmentally safe, inclusive, and empowering GenAI environments.
          </p>

            This workshop builds on the position paper
            <em>"Developmentally Safe Generative AI Environment for Youth"</em>, to appear at the

            <p>
              The overarching objective of this workshop is to assemble a diverse, interdisciplinary community invested
              in youth-centered inquiry around generative AI, and to co-develop shared frameworks, methods, and
              infrastructures that support developmentally safe GenAI ecosystems.

          <h2>Background &amp; Resources</h2>
          <p>
            The workshop is motivated by emerging evidence that youth engage with GenAI in nuanced and emotionally
            charged ways, including seeking social support, exploring identity, and developing new forms of trust in AI
            systems. At the same time, caregivers and educators often have limited visibility into these interactions,
            and platform safeguards are still evolving.
          </p>
          <p>
            The position paper and references draw on work in youth online safety, AI risk taxonomies, mental health and
            conversational AI, and community-based design. For more details, please refer to the manuscript:
